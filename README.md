This project was created as a part of INSAID Capstone to help HR Advisors to detect possible employees who may end up quitting the organization. The data was source from the HRMS where the details of all past and current employees were being recorded for the last 15 years.

In this project the outcome is a classification  where we judge if employee is going to quit or not
